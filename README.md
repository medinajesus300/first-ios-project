# first-ios-project
This is my first iOS mini project that I have created. This project is simply to introduce my-self to iOS programming world using Swift and SwiftUI.
This is a simple app that calculates the tip using the total amount of cost, the amount of people and the percentage of tip as variables to calculate the 
final calculation.
